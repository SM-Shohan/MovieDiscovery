### Limitations


1. **Minimal Caching:** Only favorite movies are cached using Room; all other API data is fetched live.
2. **Offline Support:** Limited to favorites; trending, popular, and search results are unavailable offline.
3. **Search Suggestions:** Stored only in memory per session; not persisted across app restarts.
4. **Error Handling:** Corner cases and exceptions (e.g., network errors, empty responses) are not fully handled.
5. **Logging:** Proper logging for debugging and API failures is not implemented.
6. **Performance Considerations:** No caching or paging for large movie lists, which may affect scrolling and network usage.

### Proposed Improvements

1. **Enhanced Offline Support**
    - Cache trending movies
    - Store search results
    - Save movie details

2. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implement Paging 3
    - Add memory caching
    - Optimize database queries

3. **User Experience**
    - Offline-first approach
    - Background sync
    - Pull-to-refresh

4. **Planned Enhancements**
    - Add WorkManager for background operations
    - Comprehensive test coverage
    - Add prefetching for movie lists

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for ViewModels and Use Cases
   - Integration tests for Repository layer
   - UI tests using Compose testing framework
